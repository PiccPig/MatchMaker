This is the first project i've put serious effort into developing, so here's what's wrong with it at the moment:
  - Haven't figured out how to do drag and click on buttons so drag and click is replaced by toggle click.
  - yes, the grid is buttons. it is terribly slow when it gets to large grid sizes. i didnt know any better :p
  - "Replace current notes in range" doesnt work and i dont know why
  - The save file dialog doesnt create new .txt files if you put a non-existent path in, so you have to make a new txt file and select that instead.

Let me know (PickPig#5040 on discord) if theres something else wrong with it.
