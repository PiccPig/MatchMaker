# MatchMaker
A scuffed tool used for injecting match art patterns into SRXD .srtb files.
Left click for blue, right click for red, middle click for transparent. Put into .srtb file using File > Export
Patterns can be saved in and opened from .txt files.


This is the first project i've put serious effort into developing, so here's what's wrong with it at the moment:
  - Haven't figured out how to do drag and click on buttons so drag and click is replaced by toggle click.
  - yes, the grid is buttons. it is terribly slow when it gets to large grid sizes.
  - "Replace current notes in range" doesnt work and i dont know why
  - The save file dialog doesnt create new .txt files if you put a non-existent path in, so you have to make a new txt file and select that instead.
Let me know (PickPig#5040 on discord) if theres something else wrong with it.
